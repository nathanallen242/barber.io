## 1. Overview

This document details the configuration specified in the `tsconfig.json` file. This file dictates how the TypeScript compiler processes code within the project.  The configuration extends a base Expo configuration and defines strict type checking, module path aliases, and the files to be included in the compilation process.


## 2. Configuration Details

The `tsconfig.json` file is a JSON object containing several key-value pairs that control the TypeScript compilation process.

### 2.1. `extends` Field

```json
"extends": "expo/tsconfig.base"
```

This field specifies that the current configuration inherits from the `expo/tsconfig.base` configuration file. This inheritance provides a set of pre-configured TypeScript compiler options optimized for Expo projects.  It avoids the need to explicitly define common Expo-related settings.


### 2.2. `compilerOptions` Field

The `compilerOptions` field contains a set of options that customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.

| Option       | Description                                                                   | Value      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `strict`     | Enables all strict type-checking options.                                     | `true`      |
| `paths`      | Maps module aliases to their corresponding file paths.                        | See below  |


#### 2.2.1. `strict` Option

```json
"strict": true
```

Setting `strict` to `true` enables a range of strict type-checking features. This helps to catch potential type-related errors during development, improving code reliability and maintainability.  These features include:

* **`noImplicitAny`**: Prevents implicit `any` types.
* **`noImplicitThis`**: Requires explicit `this` type annotations in functions.
* **`alwaysStrict`**: Enforces strict mode in JavaScript files.
* **And several others**


#### 2.2.2. `paths` Option

```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": [
    "./*"
  ]
}
```

This option defines a path mapping for module imports.  The `@/*` alias allows importing modules using the `@` prefix, which is then resolved to the root directory of the project. For example, importing `@/components/Button` will resolve to `./components/Button`. This improves code organization and readability by providing a concise way to reference modules relative to the project's root.


### 2.3. `include` Field

```json
"include": [
  "**/*.ts",
  "**/*.tsx",
  ".expo/types/**/*.ts",
  "expo-env.d.ts"
]
```

This field specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.  The `**/*.ts` and `**/*.tsx` patterns include all TypeScript and TypeScript JSX files within the project.  `.expo/types/**/*.ts` includes TypeScript type definitions generated by Expo, and `expo-env.d.ts` includes environment-specific type definitions.  This ensures that all necessary files are compiled correctly.
