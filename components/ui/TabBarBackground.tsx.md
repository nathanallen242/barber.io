# Internal Code Documentation: Bottom Tab Overflow Shim

[TOC]

## 1. Overview

This document describes the functionality and implementation of the `useBottomTabOverflow` shim.  This shim addresses platform inconsistencies related to the opacity of bottom tab bars in web and Android applications.  Because these platforms typically render opaque bottom tab bars, the following shim provides a consistent, albeit null, implementation across different environments.

## 2.  `useBottomTabOverflow()` Function

This function is designed to provide a consistent interface for managing bottom tab overflow, regardless of the underlying platform.  Currently, it always returns 0.  This value can be interpreted as "no overflow" or a default state.  Future implementations might offer more sophisticated handling of overflow situations.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
|  (None) |  | This function takes no parameters. |

| Return Value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `number` |  Indicates no overflow.  This is a placeholder value and might be expanded upon in future versions. |

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm is trivial: the function directly returns the integer value 0. There are no calculations or complex logic involved. The return value is hardcoded to reflect the current assumption that overflow handling is not necessary on the supported platforms.  This simple implementation provides consistency across platforms where the bottom tab bar is typically opaque and prevents unexpected behavior.



## 3.  `export default undefined;`

The `export default undefined` statement exports an undefined value. This effectively means that nothing is exported by default. This is a placeholder and may be expanded in future releases to export an actual functionality, for example, a configuration value to control behavior related to bottom tabs.  This statement is used to maintain consistency of the API across different environments while enabling future extensibility.
