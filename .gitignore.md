# Internal Code Documentation: .gitignore Configuration

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

This document details the configuration of the `.gitignore` file used to manage files and directories excluded from Git version control.  This ensures that unnecessary or sensitive files are not tracked in the repository, improving repository size and security.

## 2. File Exclusion Rules

The `.gitignore` file employs a set of rules to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git.  These rules are based on filename patterns and use wildcard characters for flexibility.  The following table details each section and its purpose:


| Section          | Description                                                                    | Examples                                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dependencies** | Excludes automatically generated files from package managers like npm and yarn. | `node_modules/`                                      |
| **Expo**         | Excludes files and directories generated by the Expo framework.                 | `.expo/`, `dist/`, `web-build/`, `expo-env.d.ts`     |
| **Native**       | Excludes platform-specific native files for mobile development (Android, iOS). | `*.orig.*`, `*.jks`, `*.p8`, `*.p12`, `*.key`, `*.mobileprovision` |
| **Metro**        | Excludes files related to the Metro bundler used by React Native.           | `.metro-health-check*`                              |
| **Debug**        | Excludes debug logs and error files from npm and yarn.                        | `npm-debug.*`, `yarn-debug.*`, `yarn-error.*`        |
| **macOS**        | Excludes macOS-specific system files.                                        | `.DS_Store`, `*.pem`                                |
| **Local Env**    | Excludes local environment configuration files.                              | `.env*.local`                                      |
| **Typescript**   | Excludes TypeScript compilation intermediate files.                          | `*.tsbuildinfo`                                   |
| **Application Example** | Excludes the application example directory | `app-example`|


## 3. Rule Explanation

The rules utilize standard wildcard matching:

* `*`: Matches any sequence of characters (except `/`).
* `?`: Matches any single character.
* `[abc]`: Matches any character within the brackets.
* `[!abc]`: Matches any character *not* within the brackets.


For example:

* `*.orig.*`: Matches any file with `.orig.` in its name (e.g., `file.orig.txt`, `image.orig.png`).
* `*.jks`: Matches any file ending with `.jks`.
* `node_modules/`: Matches the `node_modules` directory and all its contents.


These rules ensure that only the source code and necessary configuration files are included in the Git repository, keeping the repository clean and efficient.  The exclusion of sensitive files like keys and certificates improves the security of the project.
