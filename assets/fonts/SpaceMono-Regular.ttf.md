## 1. Introduction

This document details the internal structure and data within the provided Space Mono font file.  The file is in the OpenType font format, a standard container for font data. It uses a collection of tables to represent glyphs, metrics, character mappings, and other font-related information. The file contains a binary representation of this data.  This documentation will describe the key tables and their contents.

<a name="2-file-format"></a>
## 2. File Format

The font file is a binary OpenType font file (.otf). The file's structure is based on a collection of tables, each identified by a four-character tag. These tables are arranged sequentially within the file, and a table directory at the beginning of the file provides the location and size of each table.

## 3. Data Structures

<a name="31-table-records"></a>
### 3.1. Table Records

The font file's organization starts with a table directory. This directory is a structured array of records, each describing a single table:

| Field          | Data Type | Description                                         |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| tag             | 4-bytes    | Four-character code identifying the table.         |
| checksum         | 4-bytes    | Checksum for the table.                             |
| offset          | 4-bytes    | Offset from the beginning of the file to the table. |
| length          | 4-bytes    | Length of the table in bytes.                       |

### 3.2. Glyph Data (`glyf`)

The `glyf` table contains the actual outlines of each glyph in the font.  Each glyph's data is a complex structure that can vary significantly depending on the glyph's complexity.  Simple glyphs might have simple, straight-line contours. More complex glyphs might include curves (Bezier curves), hinting instructions for better rendering at different resolutions, and composite glyphs (built from simpler glyphs).  The `glyf` table does not contain a fixed-size structure. Each glyph's entry is variable in size according to its complexity.  The precise format is described in the OpenType specification.  Decoding this data typically requires specialized font libraries.

<a name="4-tables"></a>
## 4. Tables

The following sections describe the key tables found in the font file, extracted from the provided byte stream.

<a name="41-cmap"></a>
### 4.1. `cmap` (Character to Glyph Mapping)

The `cmap` table maps character codes (like Unicode values) to glyph indices within the font. This allows the font to render text correctly given a character code.  It contains subtables to handle different character encoding schemes.

<a name="42-head"></a>
### 4.2. `head` (Font Header)

The `head` table contains basic information about the font, such as:

* **version:** Font version number.
* **fontRevision:** Font revision number.
* **checkSumAdjustment:** Checksum adjustment value.
* **magicNumber:** A constant value indicating the file type.
* **unitsPerEm:** Units per EM square (font's fundamental unit of measurement).
* **xMin, yMin, xMax, yMax:** Minimum and maximum bounding box coordinates for all glyphs.
* **created, modified:** Creation and modification timestamps.


<a name="43-hhea"></a>
### 4.3. `hhea` (Horizontal Header)

The `hhea` table specifies horizontal metrics of the font, including:

* **ascender, descender, lineGap:**  Vertical metrics relative to the baseline.
* **caretSlopeRise, caretSlopeRun:**  Parameters for caret positioning.
* **advanceWidthMax:** Maximum advance width for any glyph.
* **minLeftSideBearing, minRightSideBearing:** Minimum side bearings for all glyphs.
* **xMaxExtent:** Maximum extent of glyphs.
* **number of HMetrics:** The number of horizontal metrics in the `hmtx` table.


<a name="44-hmtx"></a>
### 4.4. `hmtx` (Horizontal Metrics)

The `hmtx` table provides horizontal metrics for each glyph:

* **advanceWidth:** Horizontal distance to advance the cursor after rendering.
* **leftSideBearing:**  Horizontal offset from the glyph's origin to its leftmost point.


<a name="45-loca"></a>
### 4.5. `loca` (Index to Location)

The `loca` table contains an array of offsets into the `glyf` table. Each offset points to the beginning of a glyph's data.  This provides a quick way to access individual glyph outlines without parsing the entire `glyf` table.

<a name="46-maxp"></a>
### 4.6. `maxp` (Maximum Profile)

The `maxp` table specifies various maximum values in the font, such as the maximum number of glyphs, points in a glyph, etc.  This information helps with validation and memory allocation.

<a name="47-name"></a>
### 4.7. `name` (Naming Table)

The `name` table contains the font's name information in various languages, including:

* **Font Family Name**
* **Font Subfamily Name**
* **Unique Font Identifier**
* **Full Font Name**
* **PostScript Name**
* **Trademark**
* **Manufacturer**
* **Designer**
* **Description**
* **Version String**
* **Copyright Notice**
* **License Description**
* **License URL**
* **Typographic Family Name**
* **Typographic Subfamily Name**


<a name="48-post"></a>
### 4.8. `post` (PostScript Information)

The `post` table contains PostScript information about the font, including:

* **Format Type:** Indicates the format of the PostScript data.
* **underlinePosition, underlineThickness:** Metrics for underlines.
* **italicAngle:** Italic angle of the font.
* **numberOfGlyphs:** Number of glyphs in the font.


<a name="49-prep"></a>
### 4.9. `prep` (Instructions for preparing glyphs for the rasterizer)

The `prep` table contains instructions for preparing glyphs for rasterization (conversion to pixels). These instructions are specific to the font and are used to improve the rendering quality.  The exact nature of the instructions are specific to the font and its design.

<a name="410-gsub"></a>
### 4.10. `GSUB` (Glyph Substitution)

The `GSUB` table describes the rules for glyph substitution, allowing for features like ligatures (combining multiple characters into a single glyph) and contextual substitution (changing a glyph based on surrounding characters).  This is a complex table, the details of which require specialized font-handling libraries to parse and interpret.  The data structure of this table is intricate, defined by the OpenType specification.  It employs lookup tables, and the substitution logic varies depending on the specific OpenType features implemented.
