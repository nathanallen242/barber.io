## 1. Introduction

This document details the internal workings of a PNG image decoder implemented in Python.  The decoder parses the PNG byte stream, extracts relevant chunks, and reconstructs the image data.  The code processes the PNG data according to the PNG specification.

## 2. Data Structures

No explicit data structures are defined in the provided code snippet.  The image data is processed and stored implicitly using Python's built-in data types (bytes, lists, etc.).

## 3. Functions

### 3.1. `decode_png`

This function serves as the main entry point for PNG decoding.  It iterates through the PNG file's chunks until the `IEND` chunk is encountered, signifying the end of the image data. Each chunk is processed individually by calling `read_chunk` and `process_chunk`.

```python
def decode_png(png_data):  # Main function to decode PNG data.
    # ... (code omitted for brevity) ...
```

### 3.2. `read_chunk`

This function reads a single chunk from the PNG byte stream.  It determines the chunk type and length from the header. The function returns a tuple containing the chunk type (as a string) and the chunk data (as bytes). Error handling is implicitly done by the `decode_png` function.

```python
def read_chunk(png_data, pos):  # Reads a chunk from PNG data at given position.
    # ... (code omitted for brevity) ...
```

### 3.3. `process_chunk`

This function takes the chunk type and data read by `read_chunk` and processes it appropriately.  The function uses a dictionary to dispatch the processing to the correct handler function.  For example, the `IDAT` chunk is handled by `decode_idat`.  Other chunks (like `PLTE`, `tRNS`, `IHDR`) are handled similarly but omitted for brevity.  Error handling is implicitly done by the `decode_png` function.

```python
def process_chunk(chunk_type, chunk_data):  # Processes individual chunks.
    # ... (code omitted for brevity) ...
```

### 3.4. `decode_idat`

This function decodes the image data from the `IDAT` chunk(s). The algorithm employed likely involves:

1. **Zlib Decompression:** The `IDAT` chunk data is compressed using the zlib algorithm.  The code would use a zlib decompression library (implied, not explicitly shown in this snippet) to decompress the data.
2. **Filtering:** PNG uses a filtering algorithm to reduce redundancy in the image data. The code would need to implement the inverse filtering steps specified by the filter type byte at the beginning of each scanline.
3. **Reconstruction:** Once decompressed and filtered, the raw pixel data is assembled to form the complete image.  The exact pixel format would depend on the values specified in the `IHDR` chunk.


```python
def decode_idat(chunk_data):  # Decodes the image data from IDAT chunks.  This function likely uses a zlib decompression library (not shown).
    # ... (code omitted for brevity) ...
```

**Note:** The provided code snippet only shows function signatures and a few comments.  A complete understanding of the algorithms requires access to the full implementation of the functions, specifically `decode_idat` which would include the decompression and filtering steps.  The handling of various PNG chunks and error conditions also cannot be comprehensively documented without the full code.
