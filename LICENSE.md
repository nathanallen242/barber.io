## Introduction

This document provides internal documentation for the provided code snippet.  The code itself appears to be a MIT License, and not functional code. Therefore, this documentation will focus on describing the structure and content of the license text.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a standard MIT License text.  It's not executable code but rather a legal agreement granting usage rights.  The structure is as follows:


| Section          | Description                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| License Header    | Indicates the type of license (`MIT License`).                                                                                           |
| Copyright Notice | Specifies the copyright holder (`nate`) and year (`2024`).                                                                              |
| Grant of Rights  | Details the permissions granted to users, including the rights to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sublicense the software.              |
| Conditions       | Outlines the conditions for usage, primarily requiring the inclusion of the copyright and permission notices in all copies of the software.|
| Disclaimer       | States that the software is provided "as is," without any warranty, and limits liability for the copyright holders.                       |


The license uses plain text format.  No complex algorithms or functions are present within the code snippet itself.  The core logic is expressed through the legal clauses defining the terms of the license agreement.  There are no functions to document.
