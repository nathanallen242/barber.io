# Internal Code Documentation: `useColorScheme` Hook Wrapper

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

This document details the implementation of a wrapper around React Native's built-in `useColorScheme` hook.  The wrapper, exported as `useColorScheme`, simplifies access to the device's color scheme preference (light or dark mode).  No modification to the underlying React Native functionality is implemented; this is purely a convenience export.

## 2. Code Overview

The code consists of a single line:

```javascript
b"export { useColorScheme } from 'react-native';\n"
```

This line leverages JavaScript's destructuring assignment within an export statement.  It directly exports the `useColorScheme` hook from the `react-native` library, making it readily available for use within the project without requiring users to explicitly import it from the `react-native` package.


## 3. Function Details: `useColorScheme` (from `react-native`)

While this document doesn't implement the `useColorScheme` function itself, understanding its behavior is crucial to using the wrapper effectively.

| Aspect             | Description                                                                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Retrieves the user's currently selected color scheme (light or dark).             |
| **Return Value**    | A string: `"light"` or `"dark"`.  Returns `null` if the system cannot determine the scheme.  |
| **Implementation**  |  This is a React Native hook, internally utilizing platform-specific APIs to detect the system's color scheme. The details of this implementation are encapsulated within the `react-native` library and are beyond the scope of this documentation.   |
| **Dependencies**    |  Relies on the underlying platform's (iOS/Android) capabilities for color scheme detection. |


## 4. Usage Example

To use the exported `useColorScheme` hook:

```javascript
import { useColorScheme } from './your-wrapper-file'; // Assuming the wrapper is in './your-wrapper-file.js'

function MyComponent() {
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();

  if (colorScheme === 'dark') {
    return <Text style={{ color: 'white' }}>Dark Mode</Text>;
  } else {
    return <Text style={{ color: 'black' }}>Light Mode</Text>;
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to obtain the color scheme and conditionally render UI elements based on the result.  Error handling for `null` (a case where the system can't determine the scheme) is omitted for brevity but is recommended in production code.
